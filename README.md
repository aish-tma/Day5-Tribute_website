# Day5-Tribute_website
This project is a tribute website dedicated to the remarkable life and enduring legacy of Abdul Sattar Edhi Sahib, a renowned Pakistani humanitarian and philanthropist. Built using HTML and CSS, this website aims to provide information about his life, his foundation (Edhi Foundation), and his inspiring quotes.

This project was part of my #100DaysOfCode journey, serving as a practical application of HTML structuring and CSS styling techniques, including the use of transparent backgrounds, z-index for layering, background images to create visual impact, and absolute/relative positioning for layout control.

## Key Features

* **Biography Section:** Provides an overview of Abdul Sattar Edhi's life and his unwavering dedication to humanity.
* **Edhi Foundation Section:** Highlights the mission and impact of the Edhi Foundation, Pakistan's largest welfare organization.
* **Services Section:** Lists the various crucial services offered by the Edhi Foundation to those in need.
* **Quotes Section:** Showcases some of his most profound and inspiring quotes.
* **Visually Engaging Design:** Utilizes CSS to create a respectful and engaging user experience with thoughtful use of imagery and layout.
* **Navigation:** Includes a header with navigation links to different sections of the website (if implemented).
* **Responsive Design Considerations:** While the current version might be focused on desktop view, future enhancements could include responsiveness for various screen sizes.
  
## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For structuring the content and creating the semantic foundation of the website.
* **CSS:** For styling the layout, typography, colors, and visual elements, including:
    * Transparent backgrounds for header integration.
    * `z-index` to manage the stacking order of elements.
    * `background-image` for impactful visuals.
    * `position: absolute` and `position: relative` for precise element placement.
